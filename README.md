#  Telecom Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is part of an internship, aimed at predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. The objective is to identify why customers are leaving the service and build a model to help reduce churn.

##  Dataset

The dataset contains customer information like:

- Demographics (gender, senior citizen, partner)
- Account details (contract, payment method, tenure)
- Service usage (internet, phone, online security)
- Charges (MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges)
- Churn (target variable: Yes/No)

##  Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

##  Workflow

1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Clean and preprocess the data
3. Handle multicollinearity and missing values
4. Encode categorical variables
5. Train and test machine learning models
6. Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score

## Key Outcome

A trained ML model that can predict if a customer is likely to churn, based on their behavior and account information. Helps telecom companies take proactive action to retain customers.
